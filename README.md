A code editor like JsFiddle.
==========

This code editor was created using the javascript library CodeMirror.

the features supported by this code editor are:

-Syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS and Javascript code

-HTML intellisense

-A reset button to delete the contents of the HTML, CSS and javascript areas 

For the next versions I'm planning to add the support of JQuery  as well as other Javascript libraries.
